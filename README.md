# List the things you added for points

* More than 8 knots
* Added major choice (dance with ghost or not) (lines 55-58)
* Player choice changes ending (can escape or not depends on if you dance with the ghost) (lines 150-166)
* conditionals in descriptions of rooms (33, 42, 72, 79, 100, 145)
* conditionals in actions (can or can't use knife or compass) (lines 71-91, 99-116, 129-142, 154-158)
* player can pick up knife to change ending (99-102, 154-158)
* description of foyer changes depending on what rooms have been visited (lines 32-39)
* (not all choices work as intended, user is not supposed to be able to leave until they visit all rooms, and not visiting or rejecting the ghost changes how you interact with the zombies and basement creature, but I can't figure out how to make choices that require multiple qualifiers)
